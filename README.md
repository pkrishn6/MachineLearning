# MachineLearning
This repo contains my submissions for the coursera course on Machine learning categorized by the week.

Topics:
------
This course covers topics like:
* Linear regression to build a prediction model with a training set.
* The concept of  a cost function.
* Logistic regression to build a prediction model for clasiffication problems.
    -- Using sigmoid functions to restrict the output range to 0 - 1 for classification problems.
* The concept of underfitting, overfitting, regularization to avoid overfitting.
* Using neural networks to improve the performance of building the prediction model when higher order polynomials are in play.
* Definition of sensitivity and its importance in finding the optimal theta values.
* Using backward progaration to find the gradients. Using gradient checking to verify your implementation of backward propagation.
* Using gradient descent or more optimal algorithms such fminuc to find the optimal theta.

Environment:
------------
* Ubuntu 14 or later.
* sudo apt-get install octave
* sudo apt-get install git
* git clone https://github.com/pkrishn6/MachineLearning.git
* cd into any of the weekly submissions and open ex<number>.pdf to understand the goals of the assignment.
* cd into the weekly submissions from octave cli and run ex<number> to see the code in action.
